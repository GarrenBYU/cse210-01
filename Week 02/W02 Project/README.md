# HiLo
Can you guess it? Then you should play HiLo. The game is simple. The player starts by getting one card and then the player has to guess if the next card will be a higher or lower value. If they get it right then they get 100 points, but if it's wrong you lose 75 points. You keep playing until you are done or you have no points left.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 dice 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
