# Jumper
Can you guess it? Then you should play Jumper. The game is simple. The player gets a random word. You must guess this word letter by letter. For every letter that you guess that isnt in the word, you lose a part of your parachute. If you guess the word before the end of the game then you win and don't die! But if all of your parachute comes apart... well lets just say it is a long way down :( GOOD LUCK!

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
